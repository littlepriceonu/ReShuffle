# ReShuffle

A [Cider](https://cider.sh) plugin to reshuffle the current queue.

The Plugin can be accessed by the ðŸ”€ button added to the top right of
the Cider client.

If the `Skip Current Song` is disabled the queue will be reshuffled and the song will pause briefly and then resume at the same time mark (Mind you this feature is VERY buggy, it will be smoothed out in future updates).

If it's disabled it will reshuffle the queue and play a new song.

## Hopes For Next Update

* Make `Skip Current Song` more reliable when disabled
* Have a button in the immersive menu

These will hopefully be easier when the Cider plugin API gets updated and the docs come out.
